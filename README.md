Program 1 : To display simple texts on the screen

This C++ program is a simple example that demonstrates how to display a message on the screen using basic syntax. It begins with the #include<iostream> directive, which includes the input-output stream library needed for output operations. The line using namespace std; allows the program to use standard library objects like cout without prefixing them with std::. The main() function serves as the entry point of the program. Inside the function, the statement cout << "Hello. Good morning."; sends the text message to the output stream, which displays it on the screen. Finally, the statement return 0; indicates that the program has executed successfully. When run, this program simply outputs the message "Hello. Good morning." to the console.


Core Concepts:
1. Using #include to access standard input/output functionalities
2. Utilizing std::cout to send output to the console
3. Structure of the main() function along with a return value

Program 2 : Simple Calculator Application 

This C++ program operates as a basic calculator, allowing the user to carry out standard mathematical operations—such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two numbers entered by the user. It illustrates how to declare variables, apply arithmetic operators, and display the output in a user-friendly format.

Essential Concepts:
1. Declaring variables using float and int data types
2. Accepting user input through the console
3. Executing fundamental mathematical computations
4. Presenting results neatly with the help of std::cout
